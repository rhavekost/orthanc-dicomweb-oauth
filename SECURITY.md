## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure:

### Where to Report

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report via:

1. **Email**: security@rhavekost.com
2. **Private Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/rhavekost/orthanc-dicomweb-oauth/security/advisories/new)

### What to Include

Please provide:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
- Affected versions
- Suggested fix (if available)
- CVE classification (if known)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Severity Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Timeline**:
  - Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0): 7 days
  - High (CVSS 7.0-8.9): 30 days
  - Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9): 90 days
  - Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9): Next release

### Disclosure Policy

- We will confirm receipt of your report within 48 hours
- We will provide regular updates on our progress
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)
- We request that you do not publicly disclose the issue until we've issued a fix
- We will publish security advisories for all confirmed vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices

### For Production Deployment

1. **Enable Authentication** - Always set `"AuthenticationEnabled": true` in Orthanc
2. **Strong Credentials** - Never use default credentials (orthanc/orthanc)
3. **Secret Management** - Use environment variables or secret managers (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
4. **SSL/TLS Required** - Enable certificate verification for all OAuth endpoints
5. **Secure Configuration** - Use `docker/orthanc-secure.json` as production template
6. **Audit Logging** - Enable comprehensive security event logging
7. **Rate Limiting** - Configure rate limits appropriate for your environment
8. **JWT Validation** - Enable JWT signature validation when supported by your provider
9. **Monitor Metrics** - Set up Prometheus monitoring and alerting
10. **Regular Updates** - Keep dependencies updated using Dependabot alerts

### For Development

1. **Never commit secrets** - Use `.env` files (add to `.gitignore`)
2. **Pre-commit hooks** - Run security checks before committing
3. **Security reviews** - Review security changes carefully in PRs
4. **Test with production configs** - Test with production-like security settings
5. **Dependency scanning** - Run `bandit` and `safety` checks regularly
